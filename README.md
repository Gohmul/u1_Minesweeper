# Project 1

## Task

Your task is to build a browser-based game utilizing HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

**Ideas**:
- Blackjack
- Connect Four
- Battleship
- Dice Movement Game
- Snake
- Whatever You Can Think Of

## For Project Approval
- **Your game must be approved by an instructor before you start**
- Detailed README.md (Project Title, Description, How to Get Started, Credits)
- A Trello Board detailing the plan and progress of your project (linked on your Readme)


## Project Requirements (MVP)

**Your project must:**
- Be a **new repo**. Create a new repo in your github and build your project there. **DO NOT** name your repository Project 1, give it a real name.
- Include a _beautiful_, professional **README.md** (use [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/))
- Utilize flexbox or grid (or both)
- Include a minimum of 2 HTML pages and navigation between them
- Include a minimum of 2 event handlers
- Have at least 20 _meaningful_ `git` commits. You should be committing your changes every time you build a new feature.
- Your code should be properly indented, spaced, and within code blocks. **DO NOT** leave in commented out code that was left unused (bad practice). Comments should be in your code to describe what your functions are doing.
- Display proper use of global variables and function parameters (function scopes)
- Use camelCase for javascript variables
- Be deployed on [Surge](https://surge.sh/) (We will cover this on Thursday of project week)

**Project _Completed_ Due Date:** 02/12/21 by 2:00pm EST

## Tips

- Research what you consider the best game websites out there to get ideas/inspiration
- Chat and bounce ideas off your classmates and gather useful feedback
- Commit early (day one or two) and often (everytime you implement a new feature)
- Implement all project requirements first before moving on to post-mvp features
- Use high resolution images (do not skew images, when resizing, resize proportionately) and give them an `alt` attribute
- ```html
  <img src="https://some.really-cool-image-url.jpg alt="my cool picture" />
  ```
- Make it look professional (this is for you to showcase - it could land you a job)
- Use Google Fonts in your project. To do this, find a font on https://fonts.google.com/ , select the font, go to the *embed* link, and put its HTML tag in your HTML document's `<head>` tag, *above* your link to your CSS. You will then need to use its CSS Rule to apply it in your CSS file. Example:
- ```html
    <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Sansita+Swashed:wght@500&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./style.css">
  ```


## Post-MVP Ideas
- Use a public API with your game
- Add a dark mode feature
- Use object oriented programming to create reusable elements
