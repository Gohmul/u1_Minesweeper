# Project 1

## Task

Your task is to build a basic and professional looking website leveraging a public API. Your website should allow users to interact with its pages, make *requests* (think buttons, HTML forms, dropdowns, searchbars, etc.) to your API to get data, and **display the data** (text, images, etc.) from your API in a meaningful way. Try to think of ways that you can display data from your API through the lens of a user's experience. 

## For Project Approval

- Detailed Readme (Title/Your Name, Description, How to Get Started, User Stories, Credits)
- The link to your chosen API
- A snippet of your API data (in a code block)
- A Trello Board detailing the plan and progress of your project (linked on your Readme)
- User Stories explaining how a user interacts with your website (MVP)

**Project _Approval_ Due Date:** 10/19/20 by 9:00am EST


## Project Requirements (MVP)

**Your project must:**
- Be a **new repo**. Create a new repo in your github and build your project there. **DO NOT** name your repository Project 1, give it a real name.
- Include a _beautiful_, professional **README.md** (use [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/))
- Your README should have user stories, wireframes for your project, code snippets, and a description of your project.
- Utilize flexbox or grid (or both)
- Use at least one _approved_ API (must not use Rapid API)
- Include a minimum of 2 HTML pages and navigation between them
- Include a minimum of 2 event handlers
- Have at least 20 _meaningful_ `git` commits. You should be committing your changes every time you build a new feature.
- Your code should be properly indented, spaced, and within code blocks. **DO NOT** leave in commented out code that was left unused (bad practice). Comments should be in your code to describe what your functions are doing.
- Display proper use of global variables and function parameters (function scopes)
- Use camelCase for javascript variables
- Be deployed on either [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) or [Surge](https://surge.sh/) (We will cover this on Friday)

**Project _Completed_ Due Date:** 10/23/20 by 10:00am EST

## Tips

- Research what you consider the best websites out there to get ideas/inspiration
- Chat and bounce ideas off your classmates and gather useful feedback
- Commit early (day one or two) and often (everytime you implement a new feature)
- Implement all project requirements first before moving on to post-mvp features
- Use high resolution images (do not skew images, when resizing, resize proportionately) and give them an `alt` attribute
- ```html
  <img src="https://some.really-cool-image-url.jpg alt="my cool picture" />
  ```
- Make it look professional (this is for you to showcase - it could land you a job)
- Use Google Fonts in your project. To do this, find a font on https://fonts.google.com/ , select the font, go to the *embed* link, and put its HTML tag in your HTML document's `<head>` tag, *above* your link to your CSS. You will then need to use its CSS Rule to apply it in your CSS file. Example:
- ```html
    <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Sansita+Swashed:wght@500&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./style.css">
  ```

## Post-MVP Ideas

- Add a contact form
- Build a [carousel](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/carousel/#with-controls) from scratch
- Add a search bar on your webpage and use the .filter() method
- Add the ability to sort on your webpage (e.g. ascending, descending)
- Add a filter to your webpage (e.g. by color, by size, etc.)
- Use object oriented programming to create reusable elements
- Create an [alert that can be dismissed](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/alerts/#dismissing)
